# Sliding_Puzzels
This project is used to solve a type of puzzle in path finding. The player starts at the location "S" and wants to reach the the finish, labelled "F". Each turn they choose one of the four cardinal directions to move. However, except for S and F the floor is covered in frictionless ice, so they will keep sliding in the chosen direction until they hit the wall surrounding the area, or one of the rocks (labelled “0”). Dijkstra's algorithm concept is used in solving this puzzle to find the shortest path.
